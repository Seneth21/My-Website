            <p>
                I’m a self-taught music producer and graphic designer with a passion for bringing ideas to life through sound and design. My journey began in 2019 when I first started exploring music production, and by 2021, I expanded into graphic design. Since then, I’ve been creating everything from original music tracks to eye-catching album covers, branding, and promotional materials. I specialize in sound design, composition, mixing, and mastering, always aiming to deliver professional-quality work that resonates with listeners and viewers.
                <br><br>
                I’m proficient in using DAWs like Cubase, FL Studio, and Ableton Live, which I rely on to bring my music production to life. In addition to my music production and design skills, I’ve developed a strong foundation in video editing. I create music videos, promotional content, and event footage, using tools like Adobe Premiere Pro. I’ve also gained hands-on experience in event production, managing cameras, lighting, and audio equipment to capture the best footage and sound. As a Videographer & Audio Engineer at Glamora Events, I’ve had the opportunity to work on live events, ensuring that every video and audio element comes together seamlessly for a polished final product.
                <br><br>
                Along the way, I’ve had the chance to study Jazz under Pradeep Madahinne (2023–2024), which has deepened my understanding of music and influenced my production style. I hold a Diploma in English from SIBA Campus (2019–2020) and a Certificate in Software Engineering from the National Institute of Business Management (NIBM) (2021), which complement my creative pursuits and provide a solid technical foundation.
                <br><br>
                Over the years, I’ve collaborated with brands like Roots of Musick, The Infinity, and Glamora Events, creating custom audio-visual content that reflects their unique identity. My freelance work has also involved designing promotional materials and building strategies to help artists and businesses reach a wider audience.
                <br><br>
                What sets me apart is my ability to blend music and design in a way that’s cohesive and impactful. I’m always learning, experimenting with new tools, and pushing my creative boundaries. Whether I’m crafting music that moves people or designing visuals that inspire, I’m not just a creator—I’m a partner in bringing your vision to life. Let’s work together and make something unforgettable!   
                <br><br>
                Thank You!
